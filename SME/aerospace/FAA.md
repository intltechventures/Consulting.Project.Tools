FR Part 45   
Identification and Registration Marking Part 45 identifies the requirements for the identification of aircraft, engines, propellers, certain replacement and modification parts, and the nationality and registration marking required on U.S.-registered aircraft. All type-certificated products must have the following information on a fireproof dataplate or similar approved fireproof method.
  1.  Builder’s name
  2.  Model designation
  3.  Builder’s serial number
  4.  Type certificate number (if any)
  5.  Production certificate number (if any)
  6.  For aircraft engines, the established rating.
  7.  Reference to compliance or exemption to14 CFR Part 34, Fuel Venting and Exhaust Emission Requirements for Turbine Engine Powered Airplanes
  8.  Any other information that the FAA determines to be appropriate


Replacement and modification parts, which are produced in accordance with a parts manufacturing approval (PMA) (14 CFR §21.303), must have the following information permanently and legibly marked:
  1.  The letters “FAA-PMA.”
  2.  The name, symbol, or trademark of the holder of the PMA.
  3.  The part number.
  4.  The name and model designation for each type-certificated product on which it can be installed.


If a part has a specified replacement time, inspection interval, or other related procedure specification in the maintenance manual or Instruction for Continued Airworthiness (ICA), that part must have a part number and a serial number (or the equivalent of each).


§43.10 Disposition of life-limited aircraft parts 
When a life-limited part is removed, the person removing it from the type-certificated product must control the part and assure proper tracking of the life-limiting 
factor. This is to prevent the installation of the part after it has reached its life limit.

There are seven possible methods the technician or repair facility may choose from to comply with this requirement.
  1.  Recordkeeping.
  2.  Tagging.
  3.  Non-permanent marking.
  4.  Permanent marking.
  5.  Segregation.
  6.  Mutilation.
  7.  Any other method approved or accepted by the FAA
