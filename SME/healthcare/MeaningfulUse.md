  * What is Meaningful Use?
    * https://www.practicefusion.com/what-is-meaningful-use/
      * Under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH Act), which was enacted under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act), incentive payments are available to eligible professionals (EPs) who successfully demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology. The Recovery Act specifies three main components of meaningful use: The use of a certified EHR in a meaningful manner, the use of certified EHR technology for electronic exchange of health information to improve quality of health care and the use of certified EHR technology to submit clinical quality and other measures.
      * Stage 1: Promotes basic EHR adoption and data gathering
      * Stage 2: Emphasizes care coordination and exchange of patient information
      * Stage 3: Improves healthcare outcomes

  * Meaningful Use of Electronic Health Records
    * https://www.npjournal.org/article/S1555-4155(14)00361-4/abstract
      * "The concerns on patient safety and quality improvement in health care are increasing. There is growing use of technology in health care, particularly use of the electronic health record (EHR). As this occurs, the health care system is transforming. The federal government has become involved in EHR implementation, encouraging improved health care. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services are implementing the Meaningful Use (MU) Incentive Program for Medicare- and Medicaid-eligible providers. As EHR implementation and MU Programs grow, it is important for the nurse practitioner (NP) to be aware of the MU Program. As NPs become engaged in using EHRs, MU will have an impact on changing health care systems and implications related to clinical practice and improved outcomes."
