    * "Self-funded health care, also known as Administrative Services Only (ASO), is a self insurance arrangement in the
      United States whereby an employer provides health or disability benefits to employees using the company's own
      funds. This is different from fully insured plans where the employer contracts an insurance company to cover
      the employees and dependents."
