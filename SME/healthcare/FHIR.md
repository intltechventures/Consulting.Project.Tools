  + "builds on previous data format standards from HL7, like HL7 version 2.x and HL7 version 3.x."
  + "easier to implement because it uses a modern web-based suite of API technology, including a HTTP-based RESTful protocol, HTML and Cascading Style Sheets for user interface integration, a choice of JSON, XML or RDF for data representation, and Atom for results"
  + "The CEO of HL7 argued in August 2016 that it already provided valuable features, was ready to use, and was being adopted"
  + "Because FHIR is implemented on top of HL7 and the HTTPS (HTTP Secure) protocol, messages can be parsed by wire data analytics platforms for real-time data gathering. In this concept, healthcare organizations would be able to gather real-time data from specified segments in FHIR messages as those messages pass over the network"

    * "The DaVinci Sandbox is an active collaboration between HSPC, HL7, and ONC to demonstrate a broad array of interoperability use cases surrounding provider-payer interactions via standardized FHIR resources. Program use cases are stewarded by HL7 and sandbox operationalization is managed by HSPC."

    * "SOLOR is integrated clinical content bringing together different terminology standards by using a single model that can encompass any customized content. Informaticists and developers can convert user-supplied terminologies into the single model by using open source software to produce SOLOR content."
