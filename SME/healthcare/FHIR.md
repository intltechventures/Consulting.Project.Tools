  + "easier to implement because it uses a modern web-based suite of API technology, including a HTTP-based RESTful protocol, HTML and Cascading Style Sheets for user interface integration, a choice of JSON, XML or RDF for data representation, and Atom for results"
  + "The CEO of HL7 argued in August 2016 that it already provided valuable features, was ready to use, and was being adopted"
  + "Because FHIR is implemented on top of HL7 and the HTTPS (HTTP Secure) protocol, messages can be parsed by wire data analytics platforms for real-time data gathering. In this concept, healthcare organizations would be able to gather real-time data from specified segments in FHIR messages as those messages pass over the network"
