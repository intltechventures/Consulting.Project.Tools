  * EHR, eight eore functions:
    * "health information and data - patients' diagnoses, allergies, lab test results, and medications etc."
    * "result management - the ability for all providers participating in the care of a patient in different settings to  quickly access new and past test results."
    * "order management - the ability to enter and store orders for prescriptions, tests, and other services in order to enhance legibility, reduce duplication, and improve the speed with which orders are executed."
    * "decision support - using reminders, prompts, and alerts, computerised decision-support systems would help improve compliance with best clinical practices, ensure regular screenings and other preventive practices."
    * "electronic communication and connectivity - efficient, secure, and readily accessible communication among providers and patients to improve the continuity of care, increase the timeliness of diagnoses and treatments, and reduce the frequency of adverse events."
    * "patient support - tools that give patients access to their health records, provide interactive patient education, and help them carry out home-monitoring and self-testing can improve control of chronic conditions"
    * "administrative processes and reporting - computerized administrative tools, such as scheduling systems, to improve hospitals' and clinics' efficiency and provide more timely services to patients."
    * "reprting and population health - electronic data storage that employs uniform data standards will enable health care organizations to respond more quickly to reporting requirements, including those that support patient safety and disease surveillance."
