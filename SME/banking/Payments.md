## Terminology

- Collection
  + Collection is a payment method where the buyer asks the seller for payment through the bank, and the bank will deliver the documents to the seller. This relies on the seller’s credit, so is a bit risky than remittance.


- International Factoring
  + International factoring is a form of financing. The invoices can be securitized. The buyer and seller do not have direct payment relationship, rather the export factor and import factor handle the payments.


- Letter of Credit (L/C)
  + L/C is a payment method where the bank pays the seller on behalf of the buyer. This relies on the bank’s credit rather than the purchasing contract. The seller’s risk is low. However, the bank charges more fees in this case.


- Remittance
  + Remittance is a payment method where the buyer pays the money to the seller via banks before or after the delivery of goods. The banks provide only the payment service, no liability for reimbursement.
