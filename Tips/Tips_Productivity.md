# Productivity Tips 

In most organizations, there are some quick-and-easy improvements that can be made to help increase productivity. These are just a few suggestions that I usually try to introduce very early in any client engagement. 


## Naming Conventions

- Establish a consistent pattern for how dates should be written.
  + Recommended: [ISO 8601 Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) (YYYY-MM-DD)
    * Example (for August 11, 2024): 2024-08-11 
  + Rationale:
    * Consistency 
    * Easily recognized 
    * Avoids confusion when collaborating with international colleagues 
    * Supports internationalization 

- **DO** specify Time using 24-hour format
  + Examples:
    * Example: (for 5pm): 17:00
    * Example: (for 8am): 08:00 
    * Example: (for 8:30pm): 20:30
  + Rationale:
    * Clarity
    * Avoiding confusion


- **DO** specify the Time Zone whenever you write a time.
  + Example: 08:00 (Pacific)


- When needing to group a subset of documents together, within a folder containing a larger collection of documents...
  + *option*: Create a separate folder
  + *option*: Use a common prefix
    * *option*: Use a date as a prefix
    * *option*: Use a literal text prefix (e.g., "proj-ABC-")


- For frequently used content 
  + *SUGGESTED*: Use an underscore as the first character of the {*File| Folder*} name to **force it** to sort naturally to the top of a folder's content list.
  + Examples:
    * *_journals*
    * *_templates*
    * *_status_reports*



## Information / Document / Communication / Knowledge Management / Sharing

- **Anti-Patterns**:
  + Finding numerous copies of documents in the same folder (with "Copy", version numbers, user initials, dates, etc. - as part of the file name)

  + No sub-folder structures - everything just dumped into a single root-level folder.

  + No archiving strategy.

  + No established naming conventions.

  + Mixed use of different date formats (in naming artifacts, folders, or in the content of an artifact).

  + Massive documents that attempt to contain everything in a sngle document. 

  + No access control/restriction on potentially sensitive (or confidential) content (e.g., corporate strategy documents, legal contracts, etc.)


- **DO** create a *Shared Glossary* - to eliminate the redundant creation of a glossary in every artifact. Simply provide the Shared Glossary.

- **DO** create a shared wiki for team collaboration
  + Rationale:
    * A wiki is a living document - you don't have to guess where the lastest version is stored (like a document).
    * Easily updated/maintained. 
    * A collaborative effort - anyone on the team can help improve the content. 
    * Easily search across all of the wiki pages.
    * *Usally* support versioning of pages.
    * *May* support fine-grain permission (e.g., ability to restrict access, limit who may edit vs. view, etc.)


- **DO** write daily journals / blog posts


- **DO NOT** send documents as attachments (e.g., in chat messages, or email)
  + Rationale:
    * Avoids needing to send corrections/updates
    * Hides where the source document is stored 
    * Results in multiple copies being distributed - with no visibility to any subsequent forwarding actions to others. 
    * Results in a proliferation of [n] copies of the document existing, and possibly being stored in [m] locations.
    * In one case, I observed an organization's chat message retention policy that forced deletion of content after 30 days. 
   

- **DO NOT** send a link to a *specific* **document**
  + Rationale:
    * Direct links are more fragile than links to the containing folder 
    * Often obscures where the document is actually stored 
    * If a document is deleted and re-added (even if the same name is kept) - may not be the same link, on some file sharing platforms.

- **DO** send links to the **FOLDER where a document may be found**.
  + Rationale:
    * Document names may change (more frequently, over time, than folder structures)
    * Related documents can be added to the folder, without needing to send additional links 
    * Supports serendipity (i.e., discovery of the nearby, and adjacent)


- Archival Strategies:
  + File Sharing Platforms:
    * Create an "_archived" folder
      * create separate sub-folders, by YYYY
        * Create a *"{YYYY-MM-DD} SNAPSHOT"* folder to identify WHEN something was archived
