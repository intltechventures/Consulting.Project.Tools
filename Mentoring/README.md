# Mentoring Tips

- Check your intentions, first.
- Focus on helping someone become more successful. 


- Ask permission, create psychological safety. 
  + "Would you like some feedback?" 


- Framing
  + Use the “When… then…” structure
    * This keeps things factual and neutral.
    * Format: “When you do X… then Y happens.”


- No criticism - just coaching.
- Frequent, small feedback builds trust.
- Trust creates safety.
- Safety makes the hard conversations possible.
