# Abbreviation, Acronyms, Terminology

- https://www.acronymfinder.com/


This glossary is intended to provide a single refernce to be reused across multiple projects - and design artifacts. Defining localized/specialized terms may then be limited to being addressed in specific design artifacts. The intent is to avoid duplication of a large corpus of glossary entries, in many places.
