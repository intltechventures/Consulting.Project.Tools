- Title Page

1.0 Purpose of Document
  + A brief statement of the purpose of this document and the plan for the systems engineering activities with special emphasis on the engineering challenges of the system to be built.


2.0 Scope of Project 
  + A brief description of the planned project and the objectives of the system to be built. Special emphasis is placed on the project’s complexities and challenges that must be addressed by the systems engineering efforts.


3.0 Technical Planning and Control
  + Lays out the plan for the systems engineering activities. It must be written in close synchronization with the project’s Project Plan. Unnecessary duplication between the Project Plan and the SEMP should be avoided. 
  + These activities should be created for almost any project. They may be a part of the Project Plan, but if not should be part of the SEMP: 
    * Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
    * Task Deliverables
    * Task Decision Gates
    * Reviews and Meetings
    * Systems Engineering Schedule
    * Risk Management Plan


4.0 Systems Engineering Process
  + Describes the intended execution of the systems engineering steps used to develop the system. 
    * System Requirements Analysis
    * Sub-system [Functional] Analysis
    * Design Synthesis 
    * System Analysis


5.0 Transitioning Critical Technologies
  + Describe the methods and processes to be used to identify, evaluate, select, and incorporate critical technologies into the system design. 


6.0 Integration of the System
  + Describes the methods to be used to integrate the developed components into a functional system that meets the system requirements and is operationally supportable. 


7.0 Integration of the Systems Engineering Effort 
  + Addresses the integration of the multi-disciplinary organizations or teams that will be performing the systems engineering activities. 


8.0 Applicable Documents 
  + Lists the applicable documents which are inputs to the project
    * Relevant IT Architecture descriptions
    * Planning documents 
    * Procedures
    * Standards & Specifications 
    * External system interfaces
    * etc.
