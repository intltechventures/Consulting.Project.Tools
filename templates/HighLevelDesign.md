General Purpose Template for the structure of a High Level Design document (HLD)

```
The goal of an HLD is enable communication and coordination, both within teams and organizations - as well as serving as a tool for communication and coordination with external partners.

The HLD provides a consistent format for teams to assemble details - and is intended to provide sufficient information to Program/Project Management to be able to plan and coordinate large-scale development efforts. 

The target level of detail is to scope the effort, provide sufficient input to the estimation process, and to clearly articulate the How of an approach.  

Investing effort in the creation of the  HLD is intended for larger-scoped tasks - that have some non-trivial unknowns or coordination challenges.
