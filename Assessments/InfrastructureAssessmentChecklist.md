# Infrastructure Assessment Checklist - Ideation

- ```Illustrative, not exhustive```

- Someone reached out to me recently, asking for ideas on doing an assessment for a specific area of IT. 
- This is an illustrative example of some of the types of artifacts that might be considered for inclusion in such as exercise.
- Such assessments might typically be performed on regularly scheduled basis (e.g., every [n] years), as part of a leadership transition plan, company acquisition, or a private equity investment.
