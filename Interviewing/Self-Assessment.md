# Self-Assesment Scoring Definitions

Often, when conducting interviews to assess candidates, I want to get a quick snapshot of how they might rate their knowledge of various technical areas - and want to establish a consistent scoring approach that eliminates the sometimes very subjective nature of this type of questioning.   

The following is my go-to approach in establishing a consistent definition of a scale (0-10) for candidates to use in their self-assessment during the interview process:


|Score | Self-Assessment Definition|
|------|-----------|
0 | Never heard of it. 
1 | Some awareness. <br>The term is in your conscious mind - but you would be challenged to define/describe it in any detail. 
2 | Read some article(s). 
3 | Read a book.
4 | Took a course. <br>Note: This is the score to use if you have a certification - __but have never actually used the skill in the design/construction/delivery of a project/solution into production.__
5 | Downloaded and experimented. <br>This could be on your own, or for a company/client project. 
6 | Created a Proof-of-Concept (PoC). <br>This could on your own, or for a company/client project.
7 | Direct hands-on experience using [__X__] - ___at least once___ for a production project/solution.<br>(i.e., based on your __personal__ knowledge, experience, skill - __not__ based on the skills of an ensemble team).
8 | Direct hands-on experience using [__X__] - ___two or more times___ for production projects/solutions.<br>(i.e., based on your __personal__ knowledge, experience, skill - __not__ based on the skills of an ensemble team).
9 | Recognized as __THE__ GO-TO EXPERT on [__X__] within your company (either current, or previous)
10 | Recognized within your industry, or globally - as AN EXPERT on [__X__]. <br>(e.g., participated in the development of [x], frequently invited to speak at conferences on [__X__], authored definitive books on [__X__], etc.)
