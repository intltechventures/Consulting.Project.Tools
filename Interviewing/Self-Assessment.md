# Self-Assesment Scoring Definitions

Often, when conducting interviews to assess candidates, I want to get a quick snapshot of how they might rate their knowledge of various technical areas - and want to establish a consistent scoring approach that eliminates the sometimes very subjective nature of this type of questioning.   

The following is my go-to approach in establishing a consistent definition of a scale (0-10) for candidates to use in their self-assessment during the interview process:


|Score | Self-Assessment Definition|
|------|-----------|
0 | Never heard of it. 
1 | Some awareness. <br>The term is somewhere in your conscious mind - but you would be challenged to define/describe it in any detail. 
2 | Read some article(s). 
3 | Read a book.
4 | Took a course. <br>Note: This is the score to use if you have a certification - __but have never actually used the skill in the design/construction/delivery of a project/solution into production.__
5 | Downloaded and experimented. <br>This could be on your own, or for a company/client project. 
6 | Created a Proof-of-Concept (PoC). <br>This could on your own, or for a company/client project.
7 | Directly (hands-on: i.e., your own personal level of knowledge/experience) involved in using something - for ___at least one___ project/solution into production.
8 | Directly (hands-on: i.e., your own personal level of knowledge/experience) involved in using something - for ___two or more___ proejcts/solutions into production. 
9 | Recognized go-to expert within your company (either current, or previous)
10 | Recognized within your industry, or globally - as an expert (i.e. participated in creation/development of the technology, frequently invited to speak at conferences on the technology, authored definitive books on the technology, etc.)
