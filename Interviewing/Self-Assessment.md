# Self-Assessing Scoring Definitions

Often, when conducting interviews to assess candidates, I want to get a quick snapshot of how they might rate their knowledge of various technical areas - and want to establish a consistent scoring approach that eliminates the sometimes very subjective nature of this type of questioning.   

The following is my go-to approach in establishing a consistent definition of a scale (0-10) for candidates to use in their self-assessment during the interview process:


|Score | Definition|
|------|-----------|
0 | Never heard of it
1 | Some awareness
2 | Read some article(s)
3 | Read a book
4 | Took a course
5 | Downloaded and experimented
6 | Created a Proof-of-Concept (PoC)
7 | Directly (hands-on) involved in the design, implementation, deployment, and maintenance - of at least one solution in production
8 | Directly (hands-on) involved in the design, implementation, deployment, and maintenance - of multiple solutions in production
9 | Recognized go-to expert within their company (current, or previous)
10 | Recognized within their industry | globally - as an expert (i.e. participated in creation/development of the technology, frequently invited to speak at conferences on the technology, authored definitive books on the technology, etc.)
