# Resume Evaluation of a Candidate

## Red Flags
- A repeating pattern, lasting longer than 2-3 years, of short-term assignments - with roles usually lasting no longer than 3-7 months.
- For anyone with more than 5-7 years of experience, never having spent more than 18 months anywhere.
- No indicators of having "owned" something (e.g. a process, a product/service, a team, a project, etc.), from start-to-finish


## Potential Red Flags
- For anyone with more than 5-7 years experience, an absence of continuing self-education efforts
- Resumes that are more than 3-5 pages long


## Assessing for "Fluffiness"
The following words and phrases are exemplars of **usually** significant indicators that the person is a talker, not do-er.
- "spent time..."
- "extensively..."
- "worked closely with..."
- "used the {some tool} to..." 
- "maintained..." 
- "key enabler..."
- "responsibler for..."
- "effective"
- "strong leader"
- "handled presentations"
- "interacted with..."
- "coordinated with..."
- "participated in..."
- "communicated..."
- "supported..."
- "acted as..."



## Vagueness vs. Precision
- "many" vs. {an actual number]
- "high level" vs. {some quantitative value}
