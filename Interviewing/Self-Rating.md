Often, when conducting interviews to assess candidates, I want to get a quick snapshot of how they might rate their knowledge of various technical areas - and how to apply a consistent scoring approach that eliminates the sometimes very subject nature of this type of questioning.   

The following has been my go-to approach in establishing a consistent understanding of my (0-10) scale for individuals to use in their self-assessment, during the interview process:


|Score | Definition|
|-----|-----------|
0 | Never heard of it
1 | Heard about it
2 | Read some article(s)
3 | Read a book
4 | Took a course
5 | Downloaded and experimented
6 | Created a Proof-of-Concept (PoC)
7 | Has been directly (hands-on) involved in the design, implementation, deployment, and maintenance - of at least one solution in production
8 | Has been directly (hands-on) involved in the desigd, implementation, deployment, and maintenance - of multiple solutions in production
9 | Is the recognized go-to expert within their company
10 | Is a globally recognized expert (i.e. participated in the creation of the technology, frequently invited to speak at conferences on the technology, authored definitive books on the technology, etc.)
