Over the course of my career - I've had experiences that repeated themselves - in varying locations, and varying circumstance -  to such an extent - that I've long wanted to codify them for the benefit of others. 

These are intended as heuristics to provide guidance when navigating the stormy seas that arise from time-to-time - in life, as well as business.


Rules of Meeks
====

\#0XX - The General Purpose Rules
====

\#1 - "Always assume they are lying bastards - and then seek to prove that assumption false."
* This rule arose from my repeated experience of dealing with unscrupulous carpet-bagger software sales reps - who often would literally make claims about the capabilities of software systems they were selling, which did not yet exist (aka as "Vaporware").  
* Over time, I've found that application of this rule to many situations - in particular, the verification admonition - would have saved me untold buckets of grief. For example:
  * Verbal promises? Get it in writing.
  * Developer says they're done? Show me the results of the automated unit tests.
  * Vendor claims they can do [x]? Gonna need a demo, proof-of-concept, talk to one of their customers.
  * Job applicant claims they've done [z]? Always check their references.   
* "We're not going to shut the project down" - they did, two weeks later
* "We're pre-IPO" - they had no intention of going IPO
* "We've sent the payment" - they didn't
* "We have a plan" - nope, nada, zip, butkus
* "What could you do with $20M?" - they were broke and not profitable
* "We're growing" - they laid off 50% of the division
* A kinder gentle version of this rule might be "Inspect what you expect"
* Also see [Gregory House, MD](http://house.wikia.com/wiki/Everybody_lies)
  * "Everbody Lies" - House
* Also see [Leroy Jethro Gibb, NCIS, Rule #3](http://ncis.wikia.com/wiki/Gibbs%27s_Rules) 
  * "Don't believe what you're told. Double check" - Gibbs

\#2 - "Never share something with someone, unless you expect them to act on it"


\#3 - "When in doubt about an estimate, multiply by three"
* This is hard-won wisdom that has proven itself again, and again.
* This rule originated with my own early experiences trying to estimate software development tasks for myself - and over time, I learned that it was pretty damn good heuristic for many of the developers that I managed (at least  until they established  a higher level of reliability).
* This rule has also proven to be true when dealing with boat yards that have been tasked with maintenance/repair jobs on my sailboat.

\#5 - "Never argue with a foolish person"


\#6 - "Listen more than you talk"


\#7 - "No job is worth sacrificing your Family, Friends, Integrity"


\#8 - "Life is too short to put up with shitty tools"

\#4xx - On Building/Making Things
====

\#503 - Preparation, dissemination, and review of meeting material should occur prior to the meeting.  Fire people who violate this rule more than once.

====

\#901 - "Your All-Purpose Survival Kit: Improvise, Adapt, Overcome"

\#905 - "Priorities: Shelter, Water, Food, Fire"


\#993 - "If you want to survive out here, youâ€™ve got to know where your towel is"
  * "... a towel has immense psychological value. For some reason, if a strag (strag: nonhitchhiker) discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, washcloth, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet-weather gear, space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitchhiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitchhiker might accidentally have "lost". What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through, and still knows where his towel is, is clearly a man to be reckoned with."  
  * [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_(film))

\#994 - "A wounded animal can heal - and attack again"

\#997 - "Two in the head, one in the heart" 
* Modification of the [Zombieland Double-Tap rule #2]( http://zombie.wikia.com/wiki/Zombieland_Survival_Rules).  You know, for the zombie apocalypse...


\#998 - "You were going to die anyway - who wants to live forever?"


\#999 - "If you must go to war, remember - there are no rules"
