# Rules of Meeks

- Over the course of my career - I've had experiences that repeated themselves - in varying locations, and varying circumstance -  to such an extent - that I've long wanted to codify them for the benefit of others.    

- These are intended as heuristics to provide guidance when navigating the stormy seas that arise from time-to-time - in life, as well as business.   

- Unless otherwise noted - these are all my own original thinking. 

- I strongly suggest you read these with a sense of humor, and a frosty cold beverage of your choice...


\#0XX - The General Purpose Rules
====

**\#001 - "Always assume they are lying bastards - and then seek to prove that assumption false."**

* Now, you might imagine that this is phrased too negatively for your gentle sensibilities. But, listen here cupcake, you would be wrong. Focus on the positive - which is the second part of the rule.
* This rule arose from my repeated experience of dealing with unscrupulous carpet-bagger software sales reps - who often would literally make claims about the capabilities of software systems they were selling, which did not yet exist (aka as "Vaporware").  
* Over time, I've found that application of this rule to many situations - in particular, the verification admonition - would have saved me untold buckets of grief. For example:
  * Verbal promises? Get it in writing.
  * Developer says they're done? Show me the results of the automated unit tests.
  * Vendor claims they can do [x]? Gonna need a demo, proof-of-concept, talk to one of their customers.
  * Job applicant claims they've done [z]? Always check their references.   
* "We're not going to shut the project down" - they did, two weeks later
* "We're pre-IPO" - they had no intention of going IPO
* "We've sent the payment" - they didn't
* "We have a plan" - nope, nada, zip, bupkis
* "What could you do with $20M?" - they were broke and not profitable
* "We're growing" - they laid off 50% of the division
* A kinder gentle version of this rule might be "Inspect what you expect"
* Also see [Gregory House, MD](http://house.wikia.com/wiki/Everybody_lies)
  * "[Everbody Lies](https://house.fandom.com/wiki/The_List_of_Lies)" - House
* Also see [Leroy Jethro Gibb, NCIS, Rule #3](http://ncis.wikia.com/wiki/Gibbs%27s_Rules) 
  * "Don't believe what you're told. Double check" - Gibbs
* Also see [Daniel Salzedo, Senior Security Specialist Technical Account Manager at
  Amazon](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/can-you-get-infected-virus-just-google-searching-daniel-salzedo/)
  * "Everbody lies and end-users doubly so...This is the maxim of every support engineer, system administrator and IT
    fellow-traveler I've ever met."


**\#002 - "Never share something with someone, unless you expect them to act on it"**


**\#003 - "When in doubt about an estimate, multiply by three"**

* This is hard-won wisdom that has proven itself again, and again.
* This rule originated with my own early experiences trying to estimate software development tasks for myself - and over time, I learned that it was pretty damn good heuristic for many of the developers that I managed (at least  until they established  a higher level of reliability).
* 9 times out of 10, when you ask someone for an estimate - if they are honest, dilligent, and have confidence in their skill - they will be naturally optimistic. However, in my experience, most managers (and, engineers/developers) do not adequately include sufficient contingency (if at all) in their plans for the following:
  * Delays due to legal review, compliance review, contract negotiations, funding approval processes
  * Late discovery of requirements
  * Effort to do a minimally proper level of design
  * Effort to coordinate (and schedule!) the necessary communications and reviews of a proposed design approach - for complex projects that involve building something new - that involve multiple parts of an organization. 
  * Effort to ensure that the Security parts of the org are involved and have reviewed the proposed solution
  * Effort to ensure that Legal has been involved and has reviewed the proposed solution
  * Effort to ensure that business stakeholders are adequately engaged, informed - and have buy-in
  * Effort to prepare Test Data
  * Effort to think through - and document Test Scenarios
  * Effort to develop and debug Test Scenarios
  * Effort to develop and execute Performance Tests
  * Effort to debug/fix issues that usually arise during System Testing
  * Effort to prepare (and test!) deployment procedures 
  * Effort to write and document the solution's design, deployment, operational aspects, and just-enough documentation to communicate with other dependent teams/orgs
  * Effort to perform the inevitable rework that arises when designing someting new for the first time
  * Unplanned meetings/interruptions - team productivity hits when folks have to attend meetings, training, the inevitable sick days - and accounting for slowdowns around holidays
* This rule has also proven to be true when dealing with boat yards that have been tasked with maintenance/repair jobs on my sailboat. Usually, the factor is closer to 5x in that case.

What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through, and still knows where his towel is, is clearly a man to be reckoned with."
