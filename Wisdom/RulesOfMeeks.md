Over the course of my career - I've had experiences that repeated themselves to such an extent - that I've long wanted to codify them for the benefit of others. 

Rules of Meeks
====

001 - "Always assume they are lying bastards - and then seek to prove that assumption false."
* This rule arose from my repeated experience of dealing with software sales reps - who often would literally make claims about the capabilities of software they were selling, which did not exist (aka as "Vaporware").  
* OVer time, I've found that application of this rule to most situations - in particular, the verification admonition - would have saved me untold grief. For example:
  * Verbal promises? Get it in writing.
  * Developer says they are done? Show me the results of the automated unit tests.
  * Vendor claims they can do [x]? Need a demo, proof-of-concept, talk to one of their customers.
  * Job applicatnt claims they've done [z]? Always check references.   


002 - "Never share something with someone, unless you want them to act on it"
