Over the course of my career - I've had experiences that repeated themselves - in varying locations, and varying circumstance -  to such an extent - that I've long wanted to codify them for the benefit of others. 

These are intended as heuristics to provide guidance when navigating the stormy seas that arise from time-to-time.

Rules of Meeks
====

```Oxx - The General Purpose Rules```

001 - "Always assume they are lying bastards - and then seek to prove that assumption false."
* This rule arose from my repeated experience of dealing with unscrupulous carpet-bagger software sales reps - who often would literally make claims about the capabilities of software systems they were selling, which did not yet exist (aka as "Vaporware").  
* Over time, I've found that application of this rule to many situations - in particular, the verification admonition - would have saved me untold buckets of grief. For example:
  * Verbal promises? Get it in writing.
  * Developer says they're done? Show me the results of the automated unit tests.
  * Vendor claims they can do [x]? Gonna need a demo, proof-of-concept, talk to one of their customers.
  * Job applicant claims they've done [z]? Always check their references.   
* A kinder gentle version of this rule might be "Inspect what you expect"


002 - "Never share something with someone, unless you expect them to act on it"


003 - "When in doubt about an estimate, multiply by three"
* This is hard-won wisdom that has proven itself again, and again.
* This rule originated with my own early experiences trying to estimate software development tasks for myself - and over time, I learned that it would a good heuristic for many developers that I managed - until they established  a higher level of reliability.
* This rule has also proven to be true when dealing with boat yards that have been tasked with maintenance/repair jobs.


004 - "Always let the other side mention their offer first"


005 - "Never argue with a foolish person"
