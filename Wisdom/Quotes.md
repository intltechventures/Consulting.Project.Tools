  + "If you perceive that there are four possible ways in which a procedure can go wrong, and circumvent these, then a fifth way, unprepared for, will promptly develop."

- [Murphy's Military Laws](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fgandon/miscellaneous/murphy/)
  + Never share a foxhole with anyone braver than you are.
  + No battle plan ever survives contact with the enemy.
  + Friendly fire ain't.
  + The most dangerous thing in the combat zone is an officer with a map.
  + The problem with taking the easy way out is that the enemy has already mined it .
  + The buddy system is essential to your survival; it gives the enemy somebody else to shoot at.
  + The further you are in advance of your own positions, the more likely your artillery will shoot short.
  + Incoming fire has the right of way.
  + If your advance is going well, you are walking into an ambush.
  + The quartermaster has only two sizes, too large and too small.
  + If you really need an officer in a hurry, take a nap.
  + The only time suppressive fire works is when it is used on abandoned positions.
  + The only thing more accurate than incoming enemy fire is incoming friendly fire.
  + There is nothing more satisfying that having someone take a shot at you, and miss. [Ploch !]
  + Don't be conspicuous. In the combat zone, it draws fire. Out of the combat zone, it draws sergeants.
  + If your sergeant can see you, so can the enemy. 

- [Murphy's Technology Laws](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fgandon/miscellaneous/murphy/)
  + Logic is a systematic method of coming to the wrong conclusion with confidence.
  + Technology is dominated by those who manage what they do not understand.
  + The opulence of the front office decor varies inversely with the fundamental solvency of the firm.
  + An expert is one who knows more and more about less and less until he knows absolutely everything about nothing.
  + Tell a man there are 300 billion stars in the universe and he'll believe you. Tell him a bench has wet paint on it and he'll have to touch to be sure.
  + Nothing ever gets built on schedule or within budget.
  + A meeting is an event at which the minutes are kept and the hours are lost.
  + The first myth of management is that it exists.
  + A failure will not appear till a unit has passed final inspection.
  + New systems generate new problems.
  + To err is human, but to really foul things up requires a computer.
  + We don't know one millionth of one percent about anything.
  + Any given program, when running, is obsolete.
  + To spot the expert, pick the one who predicts the job will take the longest and cost the most.
  + After all is said and done, a hell of a lot more is said than done.
  + Any circuit design must contain at least one part which is obsolete, two parts which are unobtainable and three parts which are still under development.
  + If mathematically you end up with the incorrect answer, try multiplying by the page number.
  + Computers are unreliable, but humans are even more unreliable. Any system which depends on human reliability is unreliable.
  + When all else fails, read the instructions.
  + If it jams, force it. If it breaks, it probably needed to be replaced anyway.
