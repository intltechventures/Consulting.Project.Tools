## Kent Beck
- "Given a behavior-changing diff and a subsequent structure-changing diff, can you derive the behavior-changing diff as it would have looked after the structure change? Can you compare the actual diff with the derived diff?" ~ [Kent Beck](https://twitter.com/KentBeck/status/1141744893200494592)
