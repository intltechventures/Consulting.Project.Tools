# Focus Resources
   

As a consultant, when engaged to provide guidance and leadership - you need some heuristics to help you quickly focus on where to find the greatest pain - and where you can help create the greatest value - fastest. These are some thoughts that may be of help in such a quest.

## Improving The Bottom Line
- My personal preference for quickly getting to a candidate punch list of where to focus - is to ask the business for a stack-ranked list, based on the following three questions/attributes:
  + Which business capabilities/processes consume the most time?
  + Which business capabilities/processes cost the most to deliver and support?
  + Which business capabilities/processes have the most steps / hand-offs / involve the highest number of third-parties?
