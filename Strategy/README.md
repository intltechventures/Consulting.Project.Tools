When assisting a client with developing strategy (or strategic planning), interviewing key participants in the organization's value chain is a good first step in collecting information.

Developing an understanding of the patterns of performance in the following areas is also vital:
* Financial
* Operational
* Customers
* Competitors

The overwhelmingly consistent obstacle for most organizations to implementing strategy - is the fragmentation of forces and lack of organizational alignment to strategic goals. This can arise from a lack of clear direction (and messaging) from the executive leadership - or from organizational resistance (active, or passive-aggressive).
