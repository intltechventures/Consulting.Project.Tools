# Project Directory Structure - Setup Resources

## Summary 

This folder is intended as a collection of useful scripts to help set-up a consistent project directory structure for every client engagement.

A consistent approach helps other team members know where to look for artifacts - across different engagements, for different clients.

The goal is to provide a systematic approach - so that new team members are able to be more productive - and to simplify the effort when looking for similar kinds of artifacts - across different years (for the same client) - or across a collection of different clients.
